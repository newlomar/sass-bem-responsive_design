Sass Partials
- Instead to havint to look through one giant long css file, you can split up your styles into multiple files and even keep them more organized with subfolders.
- This allow you to keep different parts of the website separated in different files and it makes easier to locate styles when you are debugging a website.
- Having your styles separated into differents files will allow multiple developers to work on the code base at the same time, with a lower chance of more than one developer working on the same file at the same time, which decreases the chances of having a code conflict in your version control.
